=============

This file will include all projects which is added to the repository

1. Efficient Merge Sort Algorithm using a Single Auxiliary Array.
2. Algorithm that visits all permutations/combinations of k object from a set of n distinct objects, numbered 1..n.
3. Algorithm that visits all permutations of n (not necessarily distinct) objects.
4. Program that visits all permutations of n distinct objects,numbered 1..n, that satisfy a given set of precedence constraints.
5. Program that implements following arithmetic with large integers, of arbitrary size using LINKED LIST  Negative numbers are not handled. Take maximum value of Base to make program run faster for large values of integers
		1. Add 2. Subtract 3. Multiple 4. Power
6. Multi-dimensional search engine is implemented with much faster results using generics which allow users to search for given 
set of attributes of products. 
7. Vacuum Cleaner Problem (similar to Traveler Salesman Problem): Program to find shortest path from source to source in 
which the reward collected on cleaning a dirty spot is a maximum.
8. Minimum Spanning Tree for directed graph with zero cycles
9. Maximum matching in general graphs
10. Maximum weighted matching in bipartite graphs.
